Plume replaces the cluttered stock home screen with the two things you actually use: your apps and what you were watching. There are no ads, no sponsored rows, no account and no tracking, and it stays out of the way of the apps it launches.

## Highlights

- **Tiny and fast.** A 0.4 MB APK with no third-party libraries. It uses about 50–70 MB of RAM and has no extra background services.
- **Home button support on Google TV.** The Home button opens Plume directly, even on devices where the system launcher can't be replaced. Holding Home still opens the Google TV dashboard.
- **Continue Watching.** Resume shows and films from Android TV's Watch Next list and from apps that publish their own "Continue Watching" channel, such as Stremio.
- **Clean apps row.** Monochrome logos (or the same logos in brand colour) in a single row, with names on focus, always or never. Rearrange it by holding OK, sort by most used, or hide apps you don't use (they stay in All apps).
- **HDMI inputs as apps.** A console or set-top box that names itself over HDMI-CEC (for example "PlayStation 5") gets its own tile, which switches the TV to that input.
- **Light, dark or automatic theme**, each with its own wallpaper. Add your own photos from your phone by scanning a QR code.
- **Optional Gallery screensaver.** Public-domain landscape paintings in 16:9, downloaded only if you choose it.
- **Optional weather** under the clock.
- **Updates itself.** Plume checks GitHub once a day and installs new versions from its settings (from 1.2 on). The first update asks you to allow installs from Plume.

## How it compares

Measured on a Hisense Google TV (Android 12, 1.8 GB RAM):

| | Plume | Projectivy Launcher | Google TV launcher |
|---|---|---|---|
| APK size | **0.4 MB** | ~10–14 MB | ~25 MB |
| RAM while running | **~50–70 MB** | ~65–70 MB | ~93 MB, plus a ~22 MB helper process |
| Extra background services | **None** | 2 | 1 always-on helper |
| Return to home from an app | **~95 ms** | – | – |

## Requirements

- Android TV or Google TV running **Android 8.0 (Oreo) or newer**
- A way to sideload an APK: the *Downloader* app, a USB drive with a file manager, or `adb`

## Installation

1. Download the latest `Plume-<version>.apk` from the [Releases](https://github.com/aradhyas8/Plume_Launcher/releases/latest) page.
2. Install it on your TV, using any of these:
   - **Downloader app:** enter the code **`2125356`**. It always points to the latest release.
   - **USB drive:** copy the APK over and open it with a file manager.
   - **adb:** `adb install Plume-<version>.apk`
3. Open **Plume** from your apps. Its settings panel opens automatically on first launch.

### First-run setup

Plume's settings panel includes two setup rows:

| Setting | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Home button** | Press OK. In the Accessibility screen that opens, select **Plume: Home button** and turn it on. |
| **Default launcher** | Press OK and choose **Plume** in the dialog. |

Allow the **TV listings** permission when asked; Continue Watching needs it.

> [!NOTE]
> Android shows the same generic warning for every accessibility service. Plume's service only listens for the Home key and for the system launcher appearing. It cannot read screen content.

> [!TIP]
> **Android 13 and newer:** Android blocks sideloaded apps from Accessibility at first. Open **Settings → Apps → Plume**, choose **Allow restricted settings** from the menu, then turn the service on.

### Optional: grant one extra permission over adb

```sh
adb shell pm grant dev.plume android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

This lets Plume:
- set the Gallery screensaver from its own settings
- turn its Home button service back on automatically if the app is ever force-stopped

Everything else works without it.

## Using Plume

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Rearrange apps | Hold **OK** on an app, or use **Settings → Edit apps row** |
| Hide a Continue Watching item | Hold **OK** on its card |
| Choose which apps feed Continue Watching | **Settings → Continue Watching apps** |
| Pin an app from *All apps* to the front | Open **All apps**, hold **OK** on the app (this also unhides it) |
| Hide apps from the row | **Settings → Apps in row** |
| Show app names always, on focus or never | **Settings → App names** |
| Switch between monochrome and colour icons | **Settings → Icon style** |
| Update Plume | **Settings → Updates** |
| Open the Google TV dashboard | Hold the **Home** button |

### Custom wallpapers

Open **Light mode wallpaper** or **Dark mode wallpaper** in Plume settings and choose **Add from phone…**. Scan the QR code with your phone (it must be on the same Wi-Fi as the TV), pick a photo and upload it. It becomes the wallpaper straight away. The TV turns it upright, crops it to the screen around its centre and saves a small copy. The upload page only works while that screen is open. **Remove a photo…** in the same list deletes one.

You can also copy `.jpg`, `.png` or `.webp` files to `Android/data/dev.plume/files/wallpapers/` yourself:

```sh
adb push my-wallpaper.jpg /sdcard/Android/data/dev.plume/files/wallpapers/
```

A gentle fade is added automatically so the rows stay readable.

### Gallery screensaver

Select **Settings → Screensaver** to switch to Gallery. Plume downloads the paintings (4.7 MB) from this repository's releases and stores them privately. Switching back to another screensaver deletes them again, so they only take space while you use them.

## Privacy

Plume has no analytics, no ads and no account. It only connects to the internet to:
- load poster images for your Continue Watching items
- check this repository's GitHub releases for a new version, once a day, and download it when you choose to update
- download the Gallery paintings from this repository, **only if you choose that screensaver**
- fetch the weather, **only if you turn it on**. It looks up your approximate location from your IP address via [ipwho.is](https://ipwho.is), then gets the forecast from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com).

**Add from phone…** runs a small upload page on the TV itself, reachable only on your home network and only while that screen is open. Photos go straight from your phone to the TV and nowhere else.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>The Home button still opens the old home screen</b></summary>

Check that **Settings → Home button** shows **On**. If the app was force-stopped, Android turns its accessibility service off; open Plume once (or grant the optional adb permission above) to restore it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Continue Watching is empty</b></summary>

Make sure the TV listings permission is allowed (**Settings → Apps → Plume → Permissions**), and that the app you watch publishes to Android TV's Watch Next list. Check **Settings → Continue Watching apps** in Plume too.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The screensaver option says it needs an adb permission</b></summary>

Google TV hides third-party screensavers from its own settings, so Plume needs the one-time `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` grant shown above to switch it for you.
</details>

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aradhyas8/Plume_Launcher.git
cd Plume_Launcher
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Without a `keystore.properties` file, release builds are signed with your local debug key, which is fine for installing your own build.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. Please open an issue first for larger changes. Plume deliberately avoids third-party libraries and background work, so contributions should keep it small and light.
